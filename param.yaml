photometric_band_A: 'mag' #photometric band that defines the ordinate

photometric_band_B: 'color' #secondary photometric band

reverse: False   # if True: color equals photometric_band_A-photometric_band_B ; if False color equals photometric_band_B-photometric_band_A

mag_star : [7.18264, 0.010] # [magnitude of star, uncertainty] magnitude of star in photometric_band_A [mag]

color_star : [0.8788, 0.013] #[color of star, uncertainty] color in star [mag]

met_star : [0.05979, 0.01] #[metallicity, uncertainty] in Fe/H [dex]

par_star : [8.2719, 0.02] #[parallax, uncertainty] in [mas]

#Optional Parameters

par_err_dom : False #If the parallax error is assumed to dominate the uncertainty set to TRUE, if False slight BIAS is introduced since magnitude uncertainty is non-linear with respect to ABL

use_extinction : True  # Use extinction estimate

A_lambda : [0.21,0.1]      # [extinction A in photometric_band_A, uncertainty] in mag

E_color : [0.06,0.02]          # [reddening in color, uncertainty] in mag

parameterization: 'default'      # parametrization of derived paramers: default, default2 (as default but includes phase and mass loss), log, linear

mode: 'new'  # 'new': final parameters and uncertainties are sample quartiles [0.16, 0.5, 0.84] of weighted posterior (recommended and robust way as it is independent of binning!). 'classic': final parameters and uncertainties are weighted posterior modes (derived by spline interpolation) and uncertainties are calculated as in Eq. 11&12 of Stock et al., A&A 616, A33 (2018). This method may depend slightly on binning. This mode is only available in default parametrization.

smooth: 1.0 #Default should be 1. Posteriors are smoothed using a gaussian filter. This parameters sets the standard deviation for the Gaussian kernel. In classic mode it may effect the derived posterior modes.

model_sampling: 1           # Default is 1, higher integer value to use sparser sampling on the models by using every nth model in terms of metallicity, improving model load times but possibly affecting parameter precision and accuracy. Not recommended for final calculations

plot_corner: True #if True saves a corner plot

return_ascii: True # if True saves an ascii file (readable by Topcat)

plot_posterior: True #if True saves a posterior plot (without cornerplot)

posterior_bins: 20 #send the bin argument to astropy.stats.histogram (can be float or sting), if set to -1 the optimal number of bins will be calculated by using a self-implemented algorithm provided in Hogg (2008) (arkiv:0807.4820v1). Important note: The number of bins dos not affect the results but only influences the visualised posterior plots!

posterior_fig_kwargs: {} #kwargs to sent to matplotlib.pyplot.subplot to influence the figure style, set empty {} for default

posterior_plot_kwargs: {} #kwargs to sent to matplotlib.pyplot.plot() to influence the plotting style, set empty {} for default

save_posterior: True    #if True saves all posterior results into a single hdf5 file, use pandas.read_hdf('filename.h5', 'key') where key is RGB or HB to reload the posterior into a Pandas dataframe
